# TCSS487 - Cryptography Project

This the project report for Joshua Barbee and James Deal.

This project implements KMACXOF256 for use of:
* Computing a cryptographic hash of a given file or console input
* Computing an authentication tag (MAC) of a given file or console input with a passphrase from the console.
* Encrypting a given file symmetrically with a given passphrase.
* Decrypting a given symmetric cryptogram with a given passphrase.

It also uses Dhies/Schnorr Signatures and Elliptic Curves using Ed448 Goldilocks Points for use of:
* Computing Public/Private key pairs
* Encrypting a file or console input.
* Decrypting a file generated with this application.
* Signing a file using a given passphrase and public key.
* Verifying a signature generated with this application.

The details of each function and how to use this project are given below.

## How to use
This is a Java project and is presented as .java files, not compiled. The main method to start the program from exists in the Main class, and there are no other main methods present in the project. To run, either compile the project manually or use an IDE such as IntelliJ and run the main method present in Main. Interaction with this program is done completely through the console.
### Navigation
When run, the program provides a main menu for the suite of options available. The main menu offers each functionality, as well as the ability to run the provided tests for the cryptographic machinery. To choose a menu option, type the number associated with the function and press enter. The option to quit is also available from the main menu. Some features have sub menus, such as for computing authentication tags. In these cases there is also an option for returning to the main menu.
### Computing a plain cryptographic hash
From the main menu, select the cryptographic hash option, and then select the option for using either an existing file or text typed in the console as the input data. Enter the path of the input file or the immediate text input as directed. The resulting hash value will be printed to the console.
### Computing an authentication tag (MAC) with a given passphrase
From the main menu, select the MAC option, and then select the option for using either an existing file or text typed in the console as the input data. Enter the path of the input file or the immediate text input as directed. Next enter a passphrase under which to compute the authentication tag. The resulting MAC will be printed to the console.
### Encrypting a data file symmetrically with a given passphrase
From the main menu, select the encryption option. Enter the path of the input file and then the immediate text of the passphrase as directed. Enter a name — possibly including a full filepath — for the cryptogram (a name not previously used for encryption, or the existing cryptogram with that name may be overwritten); this name will be used later for decryption. The application will save the resulting cryptogram as three separate files in the location specified by the cryptogram name.
### Decrypting a symmetric cryptogram with a given passphrase
From the main menu, select the decryption option. Enter the exact same name that was provided for a cryptogram generated with the application's encryption mode. Enter the exact same passphrase provided when the cryptogram was created, and enter the path of the output file to be created. A message will be printed to the console to indicate whether the provided passphrase is correct for the specified cryptogram, and the decrypted data will be stored in the specified output file if the passphrase is correct.
### Creating an Ellipc Key Pair with a given passphrase
From the main menu, select the option to generate a Schnorr/DHIES key pair. Enter a desired passphrase and output filename, not including file extension. The public key will be written to a file named equal to what was desired, with a .bin extension. The private key will be encrypted using the included KMACXOF256 functionality and saved to a separate file.
### Encrypting using Schnorr/DHIES
From the main menu, select the option to encrypt using Schnorr/DHIES. There is a sub-menu for deciding if the content to encrypt will come from a file or console input. The application will ask the user what the output file will be named, not including extension as this will always be .bin. If the source data is a file, the filename given must include the file extension. The location of the key file should be given without a file extension as it is expected it will always be a .bin. The encrypted data will be saved to a .bin file with the desired name provided.
### Decrypting using Schnorr/DHIES
From the main menu, select the option to decrypt using Schnorr/DHIES. The output filename should include the desired extension. The source file must be a .bin file generated by this application, and the .bin is inferred and not required to be typed in. Finally, the passphrase needed to generate the private key necessary for decryption.
### Generate signature using Schnorr/DHIES
From the main menu, select the option to generate a signature using Schnorr/DHIES. There is a sub-menu for deciding if the content to be signed will come from a file or console input. The passphrase to use when signing must be provided, and a name for the desired signature file. File extension is not required for the signature file as it will always be .bin. The source file to sign must be given with file extension.
### Verify signature using Schnorr/DHIES
From the main menu, select the option to verify a signature using Schnorr/DHIES. This function will only verify files with signatures generated by this application. The location of the file to verify a signature for must be provided with file extension. When providing locations of the required signature and public key files, extensions are not required as it is inferred that they will always be .bin files.
### File input and output
File input is done by typing the name of the file (relative to the execution directory, or as a fully qualified path) into the console when prompted.

To decrypt a file, the files generated during encryption must be in the same folder as each other, as the user is only prompted for the part of the filename they defined during the encryption process, not the unique ending characters. The program then looks for each file in turn. If successful, decryption generates one output file, with a name defined by the user. The name defined for output must also include the desired file extension, as encryption does not retain this information.
### Example usage
User input is highlighted in green, program output is in black. The small "FF" character present is  a location where the console would clear if ran from a proper terminal instead of through an IDE's environment.

Encrypting a file named "vorspeech.txt" with passphrase "weather", to output named "encod". The actual names of these output files generated will be encod_c.bin, encod_t.bin, and encod_z.bin:
